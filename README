Stock Price Movement Prediction

Overview:
This project is a Stock Price Movement Prediction system that uses machine learning and technical analysis to forecast next-day stock price movement. It integrates logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines (SVM) along with key financial indicators like Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands, and Stochastic Analysis.

Features:
User authentication & role-based access control
Load real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance (yfinance)
Visualize stock trends using candlestick charts and technical indicators
Analyze company fundamentals (EPS, P/E ratio, market cap)
Train & compare machine learning models for prediction
Deployable on Heroku Cloud
