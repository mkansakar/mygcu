            Logistic Regression is a statistical model used for binary classification, meaning it predicts one of two possible outcomes. In the case of stock price movement, it is commonly used to predict whether a stock will go up or down on the next trading day.\n
            Interpretation & Reliability:\n
                The low accuracy means the model struggles with predicting price movements accurately.\n
                Since stock price movements are inherently noisy and difficult to predict, Logistic Regression might not be the best model for this task. \n
                Real-world trading decisions should not rely solely on this prediction, as the modelâ€™s poor performance indicates high uncertainty.
